# 1. Variables, Data Types & Operators

### 🔹 What is a Variable?

Imagine you have a **box** where you put your favorite toy. You give that box a **name** so you can remember what’s inside.

That’s what a **variable** is in programming:

* A **box** (storage space).
* A **name** (label).
* A **thing inside** (the value).

#### Example in Python:

```python
toy_box = "Teddy Bear"
age = 5
```

Here:

* `toy_box` is the **name** of the box.
* `"Teddy Bear"` is the **thing inside**.
* `age = 5` means another box is holding the number `5`.

#### Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
let toyBox = "Teddy Bear";
let age = 5;
```

### 🔹 Data Types (Kinds of Things You Can Store)

Just like toys come in different kinds (cars, dolls, blocks), computer data also comes in **types**:

1. **Numbers** → `5`, `10`, `3.14`
2. **Text (Strings)** → `"Hello"`, `"My name is Sam"`
3. **True/False (Boolean)** → `True` / `False` (Python) OR `true` / `false` (JavaScript)
4. **Lists/Arrays** → a group of items, like `[1, 2, 3]`

#### Example in Python:

```python
name = "Sam"          # text
age = 5               # number
is_happy = True       # true/false
toys = ["car", "ball", "doll"]  # list
```

#### Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
let name = "Sam"; 
let age = 5; 
let isHappy = true; 
let toys = ["car", "ball", "doll"];
```

### 🔹 Operators (Doing Things With Values)

Operators are like **tools** you use on your toys.

* ➕ Add: `2 + 3` → `5`
* ➖ Subtract: `5 - 2` → `3`
* ✖ Multiply: `4 * 2` → `8`
* ➗ Divide: `10 / 2` → `5`

#### Python:

```python
apples = 3 + 2    # 5
```

#### JavaScript:

```javascript
let apples = 3 + 2;  // 5
```

## ✅ Mini-Test (Quick Questions)

1. What is a variable? (Explain in your own words.)
2. Write a Python variable called `favorite_color` that stores `"blue"`.
3. In JavaScript, make a variable `isHungry` and set it to `true`.
4. What will this be: `4 * 2 + 3`?

## 📝 Assignment & Deliverable

**Assignment:**

* Write a program (Python or JavaScript) where you:

  1. Create a variable for your name.
  2. Create a variable for your age.
  3. Create a list/array of your 3 favorite toys or foods.
  4. Print them out.

**Deliverable:**

* Submit your code file:

  * Python → `assignment1.py`
  * JavaScript → `assignment1.js`
