## Group Work and Collaborative Startup Building  

A **core pillar of this program** is **group-based product development**. Participants will be **organized into groups of 3–5 members** early in the program.  

### Group Work Structure  

- **Formation**: Teams formed by specialization alignment (e.g., Fintech group, EdTech group).  
- **Roles**: Each member assumes roles such as **Tech Lead, Product Designer, Growth Lead, Operations Manager, AI/Prompt Specialist**.  
- **Agile Practice**: Teams use **Scrum/Kanban** for sprints, daily check-ins, and retrospectives.  
- **Collaboration Tools**: GitHub, Jira/Trello, Slack/Discord, Notion for documentation.  

### Group Deliverables  

- **Module 2**: Group full-stack prototype  
- **Module 3**: Specialization-driven MVP with AI features  
- **Module 4**: Scaled MVP with monitoring and ROI projections  
- **Module 5 (Capstone)**: Market-ready MVP launched as a **startup initiative**  

### Startup Building Focus  

- Each group’s MVP evolves into a **startup project**.  
- Teams prepare:  
  - Business Model Canvas  
  - Pitch Decks  
  - Market Validation Reports  
  - ROI-focused financial projections  
- Final output: **Launch at Demo Day** (to mentors, investors, and community).  

This ensures that by the end of the program, every group will have a **validated startup prototype** ready for incubation, funding, or scaling.
